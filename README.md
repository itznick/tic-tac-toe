## Usage

1. **Starting the Game:** Click on the "Start Game" button on the welcome screen to begin.
2. **Playing the Game:** Players take turns to click on the boxes. Player X starts first. The game alternates between players X and O.
3. **Winning the Game:** The first player to align three marks horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins.
4. **Game Draw:** If all boxes are filled without any player winning, the game ends in a draw.
5. **Resetting the Game:** Click on the "Reset Game" button to clear the current game board.
6. **Starting a New Game:** Click on the "New Game" button to reset scores and start a fresh game.

## Game Logic

The game board consists of a 3x3 grid. The game logic checks for winning patterns after each move:

```javascript
const winningPattern = [
    [0, 1, 2],
    [3, 4, 5],
    [6, 7, 8],
    [0, 3, 6],
    [1, 4, 7],
    [2, 5, 8],
    [0, 4, 8],
    [2, 4, 6]
];
```

### Functions

- **handleBoxClick:** Handles the player's move, updates the game board, and checks for a winner or draw.
- **checkWinner:** Checks if the current move resulted in a win.
- **checkDraw:** Checks if the game ended in a draw.
- **resetGame:** Resets the game board for a new round.
- **newGame:** Resets the scores and game board for a completely new game.

## Animations

Animations are handled using the GSAP library:

- **Welcome Screen:** Elements fade in from the top.
- **Game Elements:** Game board and UI elements appear with scaling and fading effects.
- **Result Display:** Winner or draw message pops up with scaling animation.

### Example Animation Code

```javascript
gsap.from(welcomeMessage, {
    opacity: 0,
    y: -100,
    duration: 1,
});

gsap.from(gameBoxes, {
    opacity: 0,
    scale: 0,
    duration: 0.2,
    stagger: 0.1,
});
```
